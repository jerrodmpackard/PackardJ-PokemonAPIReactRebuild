Pokemon API React Rebuild
Created a single page website in React using browser router and bootstrap to describe 5 jobs that interest me. Included is information about each position, why I want to work for each company, skills I need to learn to obtain each position, goals I would like to achieve in each position, and if I currently have the skills needed to be successful in each position. Also included are links to each company's website and to each individual job description.
