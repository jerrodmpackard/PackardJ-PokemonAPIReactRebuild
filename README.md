Pokemon API React Rebuild
Created a single page Pokemon Pokedex application using the Pokemon API and React TypeScript that enables the user to search for any pokemon from generations 1-5, in addition to being able to search for a random Pokemon from generations 1-5.
Peer review: Fernando Gutierrez
Peer review comments: All and all great job with the information and making the search function to work. Also the random function too Great job to make it work. Also great job displaying all the information on working I can see you did a lot to make it work all and all great job man.

 Though I can see the favorites isn't working. Also I see you can view your favorites list as well. 

Despite that great job man.
